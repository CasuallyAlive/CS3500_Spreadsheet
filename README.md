# CS3500_Spreadsheet
Software Engineering 1's first major project. Developed a system that computes elementary mathematical infix expressions off inputs from the spreadsheet widget created by the course staff. I developed the dependency map library and expression evaluator from course provided specifications documents or interfaces. Deployed the forms designer toolkit on Visual Studio to append to the spreadsheet and added additional ui specific features such as saving/loading, buttons, pop-up windows, and key mappings. If you're currenctly in the course, then be a good college student and leave my stuff alone, else feel the eventual pounding from the CS department.
